# 4BitTinyProcessor-ECE375
A tiny processor that can preform 4 operations <br>
I have decided to enclude my 4bit processor instead of the since the 8 bit one has a few bugs and is still in partial development. <br>
Howver the fundemental knowledge and procedures followed within both designs is practically t he same with the exception of more operations within the 8 bit processor. <br>
To add the 8 bit design is a **personal project** and i would rather take more time fully tackling all the minor details to optimize performance. <br> <br>
Therefore included here are the files ad pricesure for a fully functiol tiny processor that can prefrm 8 operations: <br>
1) load register A <br>
2) Complement register A <br>
3) Move Register A to Register B(move contents) <br>
4) Swap register A and B (swap contents) <br> <br>
Files included are project report, main test bench, main schematic and waveforms. <br>
**The report includes detailed steps and procedures**
