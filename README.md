# 4BitTinyProcessor-ECE375
A tiny processor that can preform 4 operations <br>
I have decided to enclude my 4 bit processor instead of the since the 8 bit. <br>
The 8 bit processor is a **Personal project** and has a few bugs and is still in partial development. <br>
However the fundemental knowledge and procedures followed within both designs is practically the same with the exception of more operations within the 8 bit processor. <br> <br>
Therefore included here are the files ad procedure for a fully functional 4 bit tiny processor that can preform these operations: <br>
1) load register A <br>
2) Complement register A <br>
3) Move Register A to Register B(move contents) <br>
4) Swap register A and B (swap contents) <br> <br>
Files included are project report, main test bench, main schematic and waveforms. <br>
**The report includes detailed steps and procedures**
